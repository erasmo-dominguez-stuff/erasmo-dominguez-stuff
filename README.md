# 📁 erasmo-dominguez-stuff – A Living CV

This GitHub organization serves as my **living, verifiable portfolio**, where every repository acts as proof of work. It reflects my mindset:

> ✅ **Proof instead of promise**  
> 🔍 **GitHub demonstration instead of resume lines**  
> 🚢 **Ship instead of talk**

Here I publish practical, referenceable, and reusable content I’ve created or explored across DevOps, SRE, Observability, Machine Learning, Infrastructure as Code, and Software Engineering.

## 🧭 Repository Categories & Tags

Each repository is tagged using a **structured topic model** to describe its:

- **Purpose** – Why this repository exists
- **Technology** – What it focuses on
- **Source or Reference** – Is it based on a book, course, etc.

### 🏷️ Tag Types

| Tag Type   | Examples                                            | Description |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `purpose`  | `portfolio`, `workshop`, `notes`, `learning`, `proof`, `reference` | What role the repo plays in my professional growth |
| `tech`     | `terraform`, `kubernetes`, `ml`, `python`, `go`, `observability`, `iac`, `cloud-native` | The main technologies used |
| `source`   | `with-book`, `with-course`, `based-on-x`, `deepdive`, `forked-repo` | Indicates that it's derived from or inspired by a specific resource |

> Repositories will typically include 2–4 of these tags.

## 📚 Terminology Dictionary

| Term         | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `portfolio`  | Project that demonstrates real professional experience or skills relevant to my career. It's meant to be shared with recruiters or teams. |
| `workshop`   | A repository structured to teach others how to use a tool or technique. Often includes examples, guided steps, and slides or recordings. |
| `notes`      | Study notes or summaries of books, courses, or concepts I’ve explored. Includes both personal notes and public knowledge distillations. |
| `learning`   | A project created as part of my own learning process. Often rougher, but shows hands-on effort to master a concept. |
| `proof`      | A concrete deliverable to demonstrate mastery of a tool or pattern — “I can do this” instead of “I claim I can.” |
| `reference`  | A utility or template that I (or others) can reuse in real projects. Serves as a source of truth or best practices. |
| `with-book`  | The project was built alongside a book (e.g., *Terraform Up & Running*). |
| `with-course`| Inspired by or built during an online course (e.g., Coursera, Udemy). |

## 🗃️ Centralized Resources

To keep track of learning sources, books, and references, I maintain:

🔗 [`resources-by-topic`](https://github.com/erasmo-dominguez-stuff/resources-by-topic)  
Contains curated books, articles, and course references grouped by topic (Terraform, Kubernetes, Observability, etc.)

## 🙌 Why This Matters

Instead of listing buzzwords or promises on a resume, this organization offers:

- Verifiable public repositories  
- Hands-on demos of skills  
- Reusable tools others can benefit from  
- A window into how I learn, teach, and deliver
