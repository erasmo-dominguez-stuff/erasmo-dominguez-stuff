# 📁 erasmo-dominguez-stuff 

> This GitHub organization is where I collect and organize the things I actually do:
projects, notes, ideas, posts, experiments, learnings — all in one place.

> You’ll find things here ranging from DevOps and SRE to observability, ML, infrastructure as code, and software engineering.
Some are clean. Some are messy. All are real.

# 🏷️ Tagging System (Based on Purpose and Structure)

To make this organization easy to navigate (for myself and others), each repository includes tags based on **why it exists**, **what it is**, **how it came to life**, and **what technologies it involves**.

---

## 🔍 `why` – Why does this repo exist?

| Tag        | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `learning` | Built to explore or understand a topic better — part of my personal learning process. |
| `teaching` | Designed to help others learn — includes explanations, examples, or guided materials. |
| `proof`    | A concrete deliverable that demonstrates mastery of a tool or concept. |
| `reference`| A utility, example, or pattern meant to be reused — a source of truth or best practices. |

---

## 📦 `what` – What kind of repo is it?

| Tag         | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `project`   | A complete, functional project — often with real-world applicability. |
| `workshop`  | A guided repo used in training or presentations, including exercises or demos. |
| `notes`     | Structured notes, takeaways, or summaries from books, courses, or research. |
| `template`  | A boilerplate or base project to be reused as a starting point. |
| `exploration` | A less polished sandbox — used for experimenting and testing ideas. |

---

## 🧪 `how` – How did it come to life?

| Tag           | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `from-book`   | Created alongside a technical book. |
| `from-course` | Built as part of an online course. |
| `forked`      | A fork that I modified, studied, or extended. |
| `inspired-by-x` | Sparked by a talk, article, or another open-source repo. |

---

## ⚙️ `tech` – What technologies are involved?

| Tag           | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `python`, `go`, `terraform`, `kubernetes`, `ml`, `observability`, `iac`, `cloud`, etc. | Main technologies used in the repo. Usually 1–2 per project. |

## 🎯 Recommended Topic Mapping

You can map your tag categories directly to GitHub topics:

| Tag Category | Example GitHub Topics                            |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `why`        | `learning`, `teaching`, `proof`, `reference`     |
| `what`       | `project`, `notes`, `workshop`, `template`, `exploration` |
| `how`        | `from-course`, `from-book`, `inspired-by-x`, `forked` |
| `tech`       | `terraform`, `github`, `kubernetes`, `ml`, etc.  |
